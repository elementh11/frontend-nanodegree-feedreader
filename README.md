## Project Overview

The Feed Reader Testing is a project part of my Udacity FEND Nano Degree. Here is the description:

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

The project rubric is available here: [Feed Reader Testing Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric).

## How to run

To run the tests: download or clone this repo and open the `index.html` file on your browser; you can also find a live hosted version here:
[ Feed Reader Testing Project ](https://elementh11.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).


## Contributing

Currently, this project has 11 contributors: me and other people from Udacity, who provided the starter code and other assets.
